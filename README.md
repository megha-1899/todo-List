# Todo-List

We have done the TODO List Project using MERN Stack which includes MOngoDB, Express, React and Node.js. This will help you to get all those tasks out of your head and onto your To-Do List to regain clarity & do more. This will work as task manager to oraganize your day-to-day life. The users can read, add, update, and delete their to-do list in the table using the web interface. The application gives a feature to the user to add a deadline to their task so that it user can be reminded of the last day to complete the project

## Features
* Add the task onto the list
* Mark as completed
* Delete the existing data
* Update the existing data
